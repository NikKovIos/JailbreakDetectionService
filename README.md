# JailbreakDetectionService
Service to check if your device was jailbroken.

Apple don't provide legal checker for jailbreak. So I make own detector with this doc https://github.com/vadim-a-yegorov/Jailbreak-detection-The-modern-way and this repo https://github.com/koko1928/Jailbreak-detection-tool.

Also maybe you would need:

- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/establishing-your-app-s-integrity
